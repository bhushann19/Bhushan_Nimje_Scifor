    "1. **Output Range**: For positive inputs, ELU behaves like an identity function x. For negative inputs, it produces values in the range of (−α,0). This makes the output range of ELU (−α,∞).\n",
    "2. **Smooth and Continuous**: ELU is a smooth and continuous function, ensuring that gradients are well-behaved during backpropagation. This continuity helps in stable learning.\n",
    "3. **Zero-Centered**: ELU outputs can be negative, pushing mean activations closer to zero. This can speed up learning by reducing the bias shift in neurons.\n",
    "4. **Vanishing Gradient**: ELU mitigates the vanishing gradient problem by having a non-zero gradient for negative inputs. This ensures that the weights continue to update even when the inputs are negative, preventing neurons from becoming inactive."

    "1. **Prevents Neuron Death**: ELU mitigates the dying ReLU problem by ensuring that neurons have a small, non-zero gradient for negative inputs. This keeps neurons active and learning.\n",
    "2. **Faster Convergence**: The zero-centered nature of ELU activations can lead to faster convergence during training. By centering the activations around zero, ELU reduces bias shifts and can improve the efficiency of gradient-based optimization.\n",
    "3. **Improved Performance**: Empirical results have shown that networks using ELU often achieve better performance and generalization compared to those using ReLU, particularly in deep networks."

    "2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The performance of ELU can depend on the choice of the α parameter. While α=1 is a common default, different datasets and architectures may benefit from tuning this parameter."
