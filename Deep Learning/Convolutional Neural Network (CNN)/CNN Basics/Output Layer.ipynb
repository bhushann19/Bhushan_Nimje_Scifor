    "    \n",
    "   * The number of neurons in the output layer corresponds to the dimensionality of the desired output.\n",

    "\n",
    "   * The choice of activation function in the output layer depends on the nature of the task:\n",
    "        * For binary classification tasks, a sigmoid activation function is commonly used to produce a probability between 0 and 1.\n",
    "        * For multi-class classification tasks, a softmax activation function is often employed to produce a probability distribution over the classes, ensuring that the probabilities sum up to 1.\n",
    "        * For regression tasks, no activation function or a linear activation function is usually used to produce continuous output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Loss Function:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * The output layer is associated with a specific loss function that quantifies the difference between the predicted output and the true target values.\n",
    "   * Common loss functions include cross-entropy loss for classification tasks and mean squared error for regression tasks."

    "## Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a CNN designed for image classification with 10 classes (e.g., digits 0-9), the output layer would typically consist of 10 neurons, each representing the probability of one class. The softmax activation function would be applied to produce a probability distribution over the classes, and the cross-entropy loss function would be used to compute the loss between the predicted probabilities and the true labels.\n",

    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The output layer is a critical component of a CNN, responsible for generating the final prediction or output of the model. It transforms the learned features into a format suitable for decision making and is associated with specific characteristics such as the number of neurons, choice of activation function, and loss function. Understanding the role and characteristics of the output layer is essential for designing effective CNN architectures for various tasks."
