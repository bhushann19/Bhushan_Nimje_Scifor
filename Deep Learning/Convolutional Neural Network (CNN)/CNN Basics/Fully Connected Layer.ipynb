    "## What is a Fully Connected Layer?\n",
    "A Fully Connected (FC) Layer, also known as a dense layer, is a neural network layer where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer. In Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), FC layers are typically used towards the end of the network to combine features learned by convolutional and pooling layers and to make final predictions."

    "## How a Fully Connected Layer is Used\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Flattening:**\n",
    "The output from the convolutional layers (which is typically a 3D tensor) is flattened into a 1D vector. This flattening process prepares the data for the FC layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Weight Multiplication and Bias Addition:**\n",
    "The flattened vector is fed into the FC layer, where each neuron computes a weighted sum of inputs plus a bias term.\n",

    "**3. Activation Function:**\n",
    "An activation function, such as ReLU, sigmoid, or softmax, is applied to the output of each neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Multiple Layers:**\n",
    "Often, multiple FC layers are stacked, with each layer transforming the feature representation further until the final layer, which outputs the desired prediction (e.g., class probabilities)."
