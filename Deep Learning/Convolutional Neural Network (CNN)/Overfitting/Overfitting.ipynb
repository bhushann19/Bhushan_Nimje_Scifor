    "Overfitting occurs in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) when the model learns not only the underlying patterns in the training data but also the noise and details that are not generalizable to new, unseen data. The following factors contribute to overfitting in CNNs:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Complexity of the Model:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    CNNs often have many layers and parameters, making them highly flexible and capable of modeling intricate patterns. However, this also makes them prone to fitting noise in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Insufficient Training Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    When the amount of training data is small relative to the complexity of the model, the network can easily memorize the training examples instead of learning generalizable patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. High Variance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Models with high variance are sensitive to fluctuations in the training data. This sensitivity can lead to overfitting when the model captures noise and outliers as part of the learned patterns."

    "## Methods to Avoid Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Data Augmentation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Description:**\n",
    "    Data augmentation artificially increases the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations such as rotations, translations, flips, and color changes.\n",
    "* **Advantages:**\n",
    "    Helps the model generalize better by exposing it to a wider variety of data.\n",
    "* **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "    May increase training time due to the larger effective dataset size.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**2. Dropout:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Description:**\n",
    "    Dropout is a regularization technique where, during training, a fraction of the neurons in a layer are randomly set to zero at each iteration. This prevents the neurons from co-adapting too much.\n",
    "* **Advantages:**\n",
    "    Reduces overfitting by ensuring that the network does not rely too heavily on any single neuron.\n",
    "* **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "    Can increase training time since the model needs to learn to work well with different subsets of neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Early Stopping:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Description:**\n",
    "    Early stopping involves monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set and stopping training when performance stops improving or starts to deteriorate.\n",
    "* **Advantages:**\n",
    "    Prevents overfitting by stopping training at the optimal point.\n",
    "* **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "    Requires a validation set and careful monitoring of performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Regularization (L2 and L1):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Description:**\n",
    "    Regularization techniques add a penalty to the loss function based on the size of the modelâ€™s weights (L2 regularization) or the absolute values of the weights (L1 regularization).\n",
    "* **Advantages:**\n",
    "    Helps to constrain the complexity of the model.\n",
    "* **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "    Needs careful tuning of regularization parameters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**5. Batch Normalization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Description:**\n",
    "    Batch normalization normalizes the inputs of each layer to have a mean of zero and a variance of one during training. This can help stabilize and accelerate training.\n",
    "* **Advantages:**\n",
    "    Reduces the risk of overfitting and improves convergence.\n",
    "* **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "    Adds additional complexity to the model."
